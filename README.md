# DES Algorithm Implementation from Scratch

## Introduction

This is a DES algorithm implementation from scratch. The DES algorithm is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. Although its short key length of 56 bits makes it too insecure for applications, it has been highly influential in the advancement of cryptography.

## Usage

```bash
python des.py
```

or

```bash
python3 des.py
```

or

using `DES.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dSRPDqgJt5MFuKv0vovahzqWAOjzhI7R?usp=sharing)
